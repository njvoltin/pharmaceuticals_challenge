Module 5
This excercise analyzes the results of treatments on mice with tumors using various treatments. First,
the two datasets need to be merged into a single dataframe so they can be analyzed. We then need to find
and remove any duplicate entries. After the dataframe has been cleaned, it is time to run some analysis.
First, the code finds the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the size of the tumors that
are being treated with different treatments. Then, there are a couple of bar graphs which show the total 
number of mice receiving each treatment. Next, a couple different pie charts show that our mice are very
close to half male and half female.Our code then creates a box plot which shows the size of the tumors
in mice receiving four different type of treatment. A line graph shows how the tumor size in mouse 
b128 reacted to a specific treatment. Finally, a scatter plot shows that there is a positive relationship
between mouse weight and the size of the tumor it has.
